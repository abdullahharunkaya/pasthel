Technical
The project is written in modular form. There are modules under the names of splash account, project, collage, payment and main. Each module has subheadings such as model, view, bloc(controller), local widget, repo, service and local utils. The architecture works as follows. Each module has basic views, which we call main views. These views are wrapped in blocks and triggered according to user actions and reshaped as desired. If the user makes a request, bloc goes to the repo and the repo goes to the service. Return the result comes back to bloc in the opposite way. Bloc redraws the view after necessary controls.
